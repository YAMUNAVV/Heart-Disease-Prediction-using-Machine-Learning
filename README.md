## 🚀 Exciting Update: Achieved 86% Accuracy in Heart Disease Prediction Project 🤖

I'm thrilled to share the results of my recent project on Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning! 🩺

📊 **Overview**
In this project, I delved deep into a heart disease dataset, aiming to detect the probability of a person being affected by a severe heart problem. Here's what I've learned:

🧐 **Data Insights:** I analyzed the heart disease detection dataset, uncovering fascinating insights that shed light on the importance of each feature and their interrelations.

📈 **EDA:** Exploratory Data Analysis was the key to meaningful results, allowing me to visualize patterns and trends in the data.

🛠️ **Feature Engineering:** I fine-tuned the features based on insights, preparing them for the model-building phase.

🤖 **Model Building:** I developed a machine learning model for heart disease detection using algorithms like XGBoost, CatBoost, RandomForest, KNeighbors, and Support Vector Classifier.

🎯 **Achievement:** After rigorous testing, I achieved an accuracy of 86% on a test dataset, a significant milestone in this project.

🛠️ **Next Steps:** I believe there's room for improvement through hyperparameter tuning, which I'm excited to explore.

I'm passionate about leveraging data science to make a positive impact on healthcare. If you're interested in the project details or have ideas for collaboration, feel free to reach out!

Let's work together to make a difference. 🌟
